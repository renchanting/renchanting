currently ill over terraria. often offtab just reading rhe wiki. ok? i love the mechs </br>
also big into: mcyt, biology, of montreal, party crashers! and others but these are the main ones

we might come off as a bit too much, zpleaaase tell us if we do!!! we try not to be too annoying </br>
preferred if people whisper to talk to us! just because we're offtab/away often. also our chat is off a lot

to greenies (/friends): feel free 2 ask for our discord... we aren't really active on ponytown!!!.

(we don't do well with new people, and we might seem dry or similar. we'll warm up eventualy do not worry)
