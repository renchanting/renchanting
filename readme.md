hi, we're aster! otherwise known as soleil / botani! (sol is also okay!) polyfragmented system with many other issues.

rot/it/ae pronouns, and we vuse i/we interchangably. we're bodily white & *very* much disabled. age is n/a on account of We're Ant.

(we're using only we/us/etc here for consistency. we'll probably default to i/me otherwise)

we usually have this acc linked to our ponies if someone other than martyn is fronting (@inthelittiewood)!

feel free to use pony name if it says "me" or "intrj" in it, otherwise use one of the ones mentioned at the top!

before you int/friend (basically a copy paste of martyns. but most of it applies to us overall)
- we are terribly anxious with new people and take a bit to warm up! otherwise we are like. puppy level of excited.
- we prefer party chat/whispers instead of public chat, but we aren't agianst using it! just more comfortable.
- we're often offtab, just whisper if you want orOUR FUCKING CURTAIN FELL WAIT

quick dni list
- the general dni (racists, homo/transphobes, ableists, all that)
- queer exclusionists or radqueers
- dream/wilbur/iskall supporters, or if you support problematic people at all (/are fans of them)
- you use the r word
