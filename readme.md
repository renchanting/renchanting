hi, we're aster! otherwise known as soleil / botani! (sol is also okay!) polyfragmented-introject heavy system with many other issues.

rot/it/ae pronouns, and we vuse i/we interchangably. we're bodily white & *very* much disabled. age is n/a on account of We're Ant.

(we're using only we/us/etc here for consistency. we'll probably default to i/me otherwise)

feel free to use pony name if it says "me" or "intrj" in it, otherwise use one of the ones mentioned at the top! or ask.

please don't directly copy our ponies! inspo is okay as we can't really stop you, you don't need to ask about it either. :-) (copying will most LIKELY end up w/ us hiding you)

if you actually read everything here then Thanks!!! we don't have a collective atabook but [martyn has one](https://inthelittlewood.atabook.org/)! feel free 2 sign it :)

before you int/friend
- we are almost always ok with people interacting!!! unless we have any variant of dni in our name. don't go off our status (we don't usually change it from busy/away)
- we are terribly anxious with new people and take a bit to warm up! otherwise we are like. puppy level of excited. we love talking about our interests and just stuff in general!!! (this will definitely vary on whos fronting and our mood at the moment)
- we prefer party chat/whispers instead of public chat, but we aren't agianst using it! just more comfortable.
- we absoltuely suck at typing & we type fast. if this makes it hard to read (or  is just annoying) please tell us!!! can't confirm we'll stop typing fast but we'll try to fix any spelling errors.
- we're often offtab, just whisper if you want our attention! will say it may take a few minutes.
- crowns are always appreciated!! we may not always respond bc of various reasons but we appreciate them all :-)
- please don't send random friend requests, we won't accept them. if we've talked before then don't worry about this!!
- we shouldn't have to say this but PLEASE treat any and all of our alters (specificially introjects) as their own people. friends r allowed to joke around as long as We know about it! but preferably check w/ us beforehand.
- we block (/mute) fairly freely. we're just extremely petty & do it for random reasons a good amount of the time. we don't usually hide people!
- we almost always try to read any and all info we can find if you have something linked to a pony!! we just like learnign about people :-) so sorry if we're quiet for a bit

- the general dni (racists, homo/transphobes, ableists, all that)
- queer exclusionists or radqueers
- dream/wilbur/iskall supporters, or if you support problematic people at all (/are fans of them)
